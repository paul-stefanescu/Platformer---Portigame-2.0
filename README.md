# Platformer
The repository for the game we developed at Porticode 2.0 (2017)
This is the game I created in a team, with 3 other friends, for the "Porticode 2.0" Hackathon, organized in 2017 by the UCLU Technology Society in London

Inspiration

Our perpetual love for the platformer arena genre had to eventually bring us to a point where we'd develop such a game of our own. We decided on using our knowledge of Photoshop in order to make sure that all of our visual assets are self made.


What it does

The game is a classic 1 vs 1 competitive platformer, the goal being to knock the opponent out of the play area.


How we built it

We started with the sprites, building our 16x16 characters, as well as the background and other textures from scratch. The characters represent two of our team members in their costumes during this Halloween themed Hackathon.
In terms of software and tech being used, we chose Unity as our game engine, coding everything in C# and Photoshop and Piskel to create the art assets.


Challenges we ran into

Most of us didn't know Unity and little to no C# when we started. We accepted the challenge. The hardest parts were managing the animations and their according scripts, but after several hours of coding and troubleshooting we managed to figure it out.

Accomplishments

We're proud of how quickly we've learned Unity and a somewhat new programming language, as well as our efficiency at working in a team. Being well organized was what helped us most.


What we learned

We learned how not to panic under pressure, thus helping us solve issues in a fast and orderly fashion.


What's next for Platformer

Platformer will hopefully become an online game, rather than single-machine operated. It is also going to receive more maps, players, power-ups and, hopefully, abilities. This is just the beginning of it.
